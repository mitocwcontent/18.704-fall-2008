Homework is assigned from the required textbook:

Cox, David, John Little, and Donal O'Shea. _Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms_ . 3rd ed. Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics. New York, NY: Springer, 2007. ISBN: 9780387356518.

Portions of the book are [online](http://books.google.com/books?id=yCsDO425PC0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Ideals,+Varieties,+and+Algorithms#PPA85,M1).

Problems with numbers between braces are to be written up formally in TeX and passed in the week after they are assigned.
